# Breast cancer detection project

### Machine Learning models 
For the breast cancer detection project, I used classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Linear SVC, XGBClassifier, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). 

### Evaluation metrics
Evaluation metrics included Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and the Confusion Matrix, optimizing model sensitivity and minimizing false negatives.
